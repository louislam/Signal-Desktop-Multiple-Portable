# Signal-Desktop-Multiple-Portable

## What is it?

It is a modified Signal Desktop using the official source code, but with:

* Multiple Instances, multiple accounts
* Portable
* Start in tray by default

Currently, I build for Windows only.

## Motivation
I need to use multiple signal numbers at the same time in a PC. However, there is no way to do that currently.

## Unknown Issues

* As originally is auto-update. Not sure what happen if official released a new version of Signal Desktop. It maybe overwritten by official Signal Desktop? I don't know.
