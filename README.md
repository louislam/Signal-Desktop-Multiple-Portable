# Signal-Desktop-Multiple-Portable

## What is it?

It is a modified Signal Desktop using the official source code, but with:

* Multiple Instances, multiple accounts
* Portable
* Start in tray by default

Currently, I build for Windows only.

## Motivation
I need to use multiple signal numbers at the same time in a PC. However, there is no way to do that currently.
